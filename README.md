# BlockchainAI
Blockchain based AI model exploration. 

This Discord bot is used to mine messages from a Discord channel and save the messages to a Firebase Realtime Database. The mined messages are tokenized using the Keras Tokenizer and stored in the database as a blockchain. When a message with the content "!mine" is sent in the channel, the bot will mine all of the cached messages, tokenize them, and create a new block in the blockchain. The block will contain the tokenized messages, a timestamp, the anonymized username of the user who sent the message, a word index of the tokenized words, and a hash of the previous block. The block's hash will be used as the identifier for the block in the database. The private key for the block's hash is generated using the cryptography library and sent to the user who sent the "!mine" message. Additionally a block will automatically mine every time the training data reaches a full block size of 2048.

The potential uses for the Discord bot along with a data preprocessing script are:

Data storage: The bot and the data preprocessing script can be used to store messages from a Discord channel in a secure and organized manner using the Firebase Realtime Database and the blockchain structure.
Text analysis: The tokenized messages and the word index can be used for various text analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification.
Data privacy: The anonymized username and the private key for the block hash can be used to ensure the privacy of the users' messages and to provide proof of ownership of the messages.
Data retrieval: The block hash can be used to retrieve the messages and other data stored in a specific block in the blockchain.
Data distribution: The private key for the block hash can be used to grant access to the messages and other data stored in a specific block in the blockchain.

The potential for using the arrangement to create machine learning algorithms lies in the tokenized messages stored in the blockchain and the word index generated by the Keras Tokenizer. These tokenized messages can be used as input data for various machine learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The word index can be used to convert the tokenized messages into numerical representations, which are more suitable for use as input data for machine learning models.

For example, the tokenized messages can be split into training and test datasets, which can be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for various text analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification. The models can be trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset to determine their performance and accuracy.

The arrangement provides a secure and organized way to store and retrieve the messages, which can be used as input data for machine learning models. The private key for the block hash can be used to grant access to the messages stored in a specific block in the blockchain, allowing for secure distribution of the input data to different users or organizations.

Blockchain-based AI language models can provide a powerful and secure way to store, process and analyze data. The benefits of this approach are the ability to securely store data, the ability to analyze large datasets more efficiently, and the potential for creating more sophisticated algorithms that may be able to recognize patterns or detect anomalies more accurately. Additionally, blockchain-based AI language models could enable developers to create applications that interact with users in natural language, making them easier and faster to use.


I will be uploading this code shortly.
